       "['  given a bipartite graph $g = (v_1,v_2,e)$ where edges take on {\\\\it both} positive and negative weights from set $\\\\mathcal{s}$, the {\\\\it maximum weighted edge biclique} problem, or $\\\\mathcal{s}$-mweb for short, asks to find a bipartite subgraph whose sum of edge weights is maximized. this problem has various applications in bioinformatics, machine learning and databases and its (in)approximability remains open. in this paper, we show that for a wide range of choices of $\\\\mathcal{s}$, specifically when $| \\\\frac{\\\\min\\\\mathcal{s}} {\\\\max \\\\mathcal{s}} | \\\\in \\\\omega(\\\\eta^{\\\\delta-1/2}) \\\\cap o(\\\\eta^{1/2-\\\\delta})$ (where $\\\\eta = \\\\max\\\\{|v_1|, |v_2|\\\\}$, and $\\\\delta \\\\in (0,1/2]$), no polynomial time algorithm can approximate $\\\\mathcal{s}$-mweb within a factor of $n^{\\\\epsilon}$ for some $\\\\epsilon > 0$ unless $\\\\mathsf{rp = np}$. this hardness result gives justification of the heuristic approaches adopted for various applied problems in the aforementioned areas, and indicates that good approximation algorithms are unlikely to exist. specifically, we give two applications by showing that: 1) finding statistically significant biclusters in the samba model, proposed in \\\\cite{tan02} for the analysis of microarray data, is $n^{\\\\epsilon}$-inapproximable; and 2) no polynomial time algorithm exists for the minimum description length with holes problem \\\\cite{bu05} unless $\\\\mathsf{rp=np}$.

       " '  one of the major problems in computational biology is the inability of existing classification models to incorporate expanding and new domain knowledge. this problem of static classification models is addressed in this paper by the introduction of incremental learning for problems in bioinformatics. many machine learning tools have been applied to this problem using static machine learning structures such as neural networks or support vector machines that are unable to accommodate new information into their existing models. we utilize the fuzzy artmap as an alternate machine learning system that has the ability of incrementally learning new data as it becomes available. the fuzzy artmap is found to be comparable to many of the widespread machine learning systems. the use of an evolutionary strategy in the selection and combination of individual classifiers into an ensemble system, coupled with the incremental learning ability of the fuzzy artmap is proven to be suitable as a pattern classifier. the algorithm presented is tested using data from the g-coupled protein receptors database and shows good accuracy of 83%. the system presented is also generally applicable, and can be used in problems in genomics and proteomics. ',\n",
       " '  evolutionary learning proceeds by evolving a population of classifiers, from which it generally returns (with some notable exceptions) the single best-of-run classifier as final result. in the meanwhile, ensemble learning, one of the most efficient approaches in supervised machine learning for the last decade, proceeds by building a population of diverse classifiers. ensemble learning with evolutionary computation thus receives increasing attention. the evolutionary ensemble learning (eel) approach presented in this paper features two contributions. first, a new fitness function, inspired by co-evolution and enforcing the classifier diversity, is presented. further, a new selection criterion based on the classification margin is proposed. this criterion is used to extract the classifier ensemble from the final population only (off-line) or incrementally along evolution (on-line). experiments on a set of benchmark problems show that off-line outperforms single-hypothesis evolutionary learning and state-of-art boosting and generates smaller classifier ensembles.

       " '  design, implementation, and machine learning issues associated with developing a control system for a serpentine robotic manipulator are explored. the controller developed provides autonomous control of the serpentine robotic manipulatorduring operation of the manipulator within an enclosed environment such as an underground storage tank. the controller algorithms make use of both low-level joint angle control employing force/position feedback constraints, and high-level coordinated control of end-effector positioning. this approach has resulted in both high-level full robotic control and low-level telerobotic control modes, and provides a high level of dexterity for the operator. ',\n",
       " '  given a sample covariance matrix, we examine the problem of maximizing the variance explained by a linear combination of the input variables while constraining the number of nonzero coefficients in this combination. this is known as sparse principal component analysis and has a wide array of applications in machine learning and engineering. we formulate a new semidefinite relaxation to this problem and derive a greedy algorithm that computes a full set of good solutions for all target numbers of non zero coefficients, with total complexity o(n^3), where n is the number of variables. we then use the same relaxation to derive sufficient conditions for global optimality of a solution, which can be tested in o(n^3) per pattern. we discuss applications in subset selection and sparse recovery and show on artificial examples and biological data that our algorithm does provide globally optimal solutions in many cases.

       " '  consider a hamiltonian system that consists of a slow subsystem s and a fast subsystem f. the autonomous dynamics of s is driven by an effective hamiltonian, but its thermodynamics is unexpected. we show that a well-defined thermodynamic arrow of time (second law) emerges for s whenever there is a well-defined causal arrow from s to f and the back-action is negligible. this is because the back-action of f on s is described by a non-globally hamiltonian born-oppenheimer term that violates the liouville theorem, and makes the second law inapplicable to s. if s and f are mixing, under the causal arrow condition they are described by microcanonic distributions p(s) and p(s|f). their structure supports a causal inference principle proposed recently in machine learning.
